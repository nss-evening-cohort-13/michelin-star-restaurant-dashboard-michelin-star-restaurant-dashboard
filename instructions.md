## Project Requirements
* Clean code - single responsibility principle
* ES6 Modules bundled with webpack
* No errors - linters should be clean
* Jquery for any DOM manipulation (selectors, modifying css classes, events)
* SASS and Bootstrap for styling
* Completely planned out - before each section you should be making new cards before you code.  You should have wireframes and an ERD

### Planning and Setup
For planning and setup, your team will need to divide and conquer. All of these items will need to be completed and reviewed by noon on Saturday.

- Create an ERD and add to Readme
- Create Wireframes on Figma and add to Readme

#### Setup:
- Create a setup branch and setup webpack (make a ticket for this first)
  - Issue Ticket Template
  - Pull request Template
  - Set up readme
  
- Create 2 branches: `Main` and `Development`
  - Protect the `Main` branch from merging (DO NOT MERGE TO MAIN UNTIL APPROVAL FROM YOUR MENTOR IS OBTAINED)
  - All development should be done on the `Development` branch
  - When a milestone is completed, make a PR against the `Main` branch for your mentor to review.
  - DO NOT move on to another milestone until everyone on your team is completed with the milestone AND you get approval from your mentor.
  
- Create a new firebase project and enable google authentication
  - Share API keys with team (DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB)
  - One person run deploys
___

### Expectations
- Break each section below into milestones
- Deploy each milestone
- Deployed URL on Readme
- Create a PR against the `Main` branch with:
  - The tickets completed that sprint
  - Explanation of what was completed in the sprint
